# Built In Roles/Perms
Global Admin permissions in the hands of a Threat Actor can be extremely destructive so these should be treated with the highest urgency and severity.
Each Azure Environment is different so detections may include templates not in this example

Recommended Templates to Monitor for any Azure are:
- Global Admin
- Privileged Role Administrator
- Domain Name Administrator
- Directory Writers
- Privileged Authentication Administrator
- Groups Administrator
- User Administrator
- Application Administrator
- Authentication Administrator
- Authentication Policy Administrator
- Cloud Application Administrator
