# Overview
- Alternate Data Streams (ADS) are a file attribute only found on the NTFS file system
- In this system a file is built up from a couple of attributes, one of them is _$Data_, aka the data attribute
- Looking at the regular data stream of a text file there is no mystery. 
- It simply contains the text inside the text file. But that is only the primary data stream

Find All Streams
```
Get-Item .\file.txt -Stream *
```

View Stream
```
Get-Content .\file.txt:Zone.Identifier
```

Add Stream
```
Set-Content .\file.txt:Dank.Memes -Value "All your base"
```

Unblock-File
```
Unblock-File .\file.txt
```


In cmd.exe, you can:
- `dir /R` to see all ADS in a directory
- `echo Hidden text > file1.txt:hidden` to add text as an ADS
- `more < file1.txt:hidden` to see the hidden text
- `type nc.exe > file1.txt:nc.exe` to hide an executable in a text file
