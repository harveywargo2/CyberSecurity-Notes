## Forest
- Collection of multiple domain trees that share a common schema and all domains are connected together through a trust

- Once a trust is established between two domains
	- it grants access to resources to the users, groups and computers across entities
- Trust can be one-way or two-way
- Trust can be transitive or non-transitive
